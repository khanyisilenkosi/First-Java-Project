✅ Example Output

This morning I woke up feeling happy. 'It is going to be a good day!' 
Outside, a bunch of activists were protesting to keep music in stores. 
They began to dance to the rhythm of the beat, which made all the activists very excited. 
Concerned, I texted Qiniso, who flew I to johannesburg and dropped I in a puddle of frozen jelly. 
I woke up in the year 3000, in a world where robots ruled the world.
